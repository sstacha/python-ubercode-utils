don't forget to increment the version number in setup.py
temporarily move the testapp to trash using file manager so it doesn't build! then restore after!
change from empty env with just python to one with twine & wheel
delete any dist or eggs
python setup.py sdist

To Test:
pip install --upgrade <path to app>/dist/python-ubercode-utils-1.0.3.tar.gz
pip install --upgrade ../python_ubercode_utils/dist/python-ubercode-utils-1.0.3.tar.gz
